    What is namespace ?

    allows you to use the same function or class name in different parts of the same program without causing a name collision.

    The Scenario

        Suppose you write an application that uses a function named output(). 
        Your output() function takes all of the HTML code on your page and sends it to the user.

        Later on your application gets bigger and you want to add new features. 
        You add a library that allows you to generate RSS feeds. This library also uses a function named output() to output the final feed.

        When you call output(), how does PHP know whether to use your output() function or the RSS library's output() function? It doesn't. 
        Unless you're using namespaces.
        
    Example

        namespace MyProject;

        function output() {
            # Output HTML page
            echo 'HTML!';
        }

        namespace RSSLibrary;

        function output(){
            # Output RSS feed
            echo 'RSS!';
        }

        #\MyProject\output();
        #\RSSLibrary\output();

        namespace MyProject;

        output(); # Output HTML page
        \RSSLibrary\output();

    use vs require ?
    use is evaluated at compile-time, require at run-time
